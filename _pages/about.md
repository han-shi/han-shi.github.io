I am currently a principal researcher at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab (Hong Kong). I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)](https://www.cse.ust.hk/) in [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by Prof. [James T. Kwok](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~jamesk/). Before my Ph.D. journey, I obtained my Bachelor degree in [Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

My current research interests are Generative Models, Neural Architecture Design and Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). Always looking for self-motivated research interns, please feel free to drop me an email if interested.
